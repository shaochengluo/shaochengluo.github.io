I am currently a postdoc in the [Cyber-Physical Systems Lab](https://cpsl.pratt.duke.edu/) at Duke University, working on ensuring robustness and resiliency of robotic systems under constraint resources and cyber-phiscal attacks. I completed my PhD at Purdue University in May 2024. At Purdue, I was advised by [Dr. Byung-Cheol Min](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/%7Eminb/) and my work was focusing on task-driven distributed control for a multi-robot team aiming at marine environmental monitoring and operations. Prior to my current positon, I was a postdoc in the Department of Computing Science at the University of Alberta, working on collaborative perception for safer autonomous driving. 

My research interests include multi-robot system control, collaborative perception, system security under cyber and physcal attacks.
