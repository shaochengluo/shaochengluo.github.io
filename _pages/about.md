I am currently a postdoc in the [Cyber-Physical Systems Lab](https://cpsl.pratt.duke.edu/) at Duke University. I completed my PhD at Purdue University in May 2024. At Purdue, I was advised by [Dr. Byung-Cheol Min](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/%7Eminb/) and working on multi-robot system control in the context of environmental operations. Prior to my current positon, I was a postdoc in the Department of Computing Science at the University of Alberta, working on collaborative perception for safer autonomous driving.
