I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Cyber-Physical Systems Lab](https://cpsl.pratt.duke.edu/) at Duke University, focusing on enhancing the robustness and resilience of robotic systems under constrained resources and cyber-physical attacks, with my broader research centered on **Trustworthy Autonomous Systems**. I earned my Ph.D. from Purdue University in May 2020, where I was advised by [Dr. Byung-Cheol Min](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/%7Eminb/). My doctoral research centered on task-driven distributed control for multi-robot teams, with applications in marine environmental monitoring and operations. Before my current role, I held a postdoctoral position in the Department of Computing Science at the University of Alberta, where I worked on collaborative perception to improve safety in autonomous driving. My research interests span multi-robot system control, collaborative perception, and the security of systems under cyber and physical attacks.
